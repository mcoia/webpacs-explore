This editor allows you to customize the screens presented to your patrons
accessing your INNOPAC via the World Wide Web server.  A number of screens
are provided as part of the standard setup of your Web Server. You may
use this facility to create other screens of information which you may link
together using HTML format "anchors".

The standard screens are :

  mainmenu.html  ->  This is the opening screen, which patrons see when
                     they initially connect to your INNOPAC Web Server.

  opacmenu.html  ->  This is an optional file, which if present is used
                     as the main OPAC menu.  It is the menu to which a
                     user returns when the selection for New Search is
                     made. If this file is not present, selecting New
                     Search will return to mainmenu.html. 

  srchhelp_X.html -> There are several of these, one for each index 
                     your patrons may search on your INNOPAC.  The one
                     letter index code is part of the filename, occuring just
                     before the "html" extension.  These are the Search
                     Help screens, offering patrons help on how to enter
                     search criteria on your INNOPAC, similar to the ones
                     used in the character based INNOPAC.

  libinfo.html ->    This is the "Library Information" screen, accessed
                     from the Web Server Main Menu. Initially it is
                     created containing one line for each of the
                     categories of Library Information you entered
                     in the character based INNOPAC (such as Library Hours),
                     with each line containing an HTML HREF anchor line
                     linking to other files containing the information.
                     These files are named libinfo_X.html, where X is a
                     sequential number.

                     You may create other files using this editor, and allow 
                     patrons to select the additional screens by adding
                     additional anchor lines in HTML format to this file,
                     referring to the additional screens you've created by
                     filename.

  libinfo_X.html ->  See libinfo.html, above

  liblogo.gif ->     This is a default file installed by Innovative at 
                     the time of the initial Web OPAC setup.
                     If you have Innovative's File Transfer Software option, 
                     you may transfer other arbitrarily named GIF files into 
                     INNOPAC using FTP, and include references to them in 
                     your HTML format screens.


Very generally, lines in an HTML document are of the form :

  Start-Tag     Some text in the document     End-Tag

The tags are themselves indicated by being enclosed by the less than (<)
and greater than (>) symbols.  A common example would be a set of tags to
indicate that a line to appear in bold face :

  <B>This text appears in bold face</B>

The text appears bold when displayed using an HTML viewer because it is
preceded by the start tag for bold "B", and followed by the end tag for
bold "/B".  The tags themselves are enclosed in greater than and less than
symbols.  There are many books and WWW Sites available which describe the 
HTML language in detail.  If you are unfamiliar with HTML, you might wish to
consult such resources before extensively modifying these files.

To have a line in one of your Library Information or Search Help screens
which directs the patron to another file, you must create the other file,
then add an "anchor" line to the first file which offers a HyperText
Reference (HREF) to the other file.

The anchor line should begin with the tag "A" (indicating that this is
an anchor line), then the HREF (HyperText Reference) attribute giving
the filename.  Next should be the actual text the user can click
on, and finally the end tag for the anchor line "/A".  Punctuation
is very important, such as the greater and less than signs around
the tags, and the double quotes around the filename.  The example
given is punctuated correctly.

An example would be : 

  <A HREF="/screens/somefilename.html">Some Text To Click On</A>

In the INNOPAC World Wide Web Server, the path to the files you
create is "/screens/", so you need to include this in your filename.

EXAMPLE OF LINKED INFO FILE SETUP:

If you want to add a line in your Library Information screen which
links to a file with information on your library hours, you would :

 o Create a new file, called "libhours.html", containing the information
   on the library hours

 o Edit the "libinfo.html" file, adding an anchor line like...

      <A HREF="/screens/libhours.html">Library Hours</A>

 o You might want to put an anchor line in the "libhours.html" file,
   which points back to Library Information, or perhaps to the
   Main Menu, or both, like this...

   <A HREF="/screens/libinfo.html">Return to Library Information</A>
   <A HREF="/screens/mainmenu.html">Return to Main Menu</A>

You can examine the libinfo.html files, and the libinfo_X.html files which
were created when your Web Server was installed for examples of how this
is done.

OTHER HTML POSSIBILITIES:

While you will probably want to consult a reference on the many powerful
features of the HTML language, a few other examples may be useful.

 o You can include GIF format files "in-line" as part of your document
   by adding a single tag of the form "<IMG SRC filename>". An example
   is seen at the beginning of the file mainmenu.html where the liblogo.gif
   file is displayed

 o You can include URL's (Uniform Resource Locators) as anchor lines
   in your file, which direct patrons to resources outside the INNOPAC.
   The format is exactly the same as an anchor line for a referenced file,
   except that the filename is replaced by a complete URL, such as...

   <A HREF="TELNET://mylocalhost/">Telnet to Local Campus System</A>

                                or

   <A HREF="HTTP://favorite.web.org/">Community Home Page</A>

 o You can provide an opportunity for users to input suggestions, and
   to suggest additional items the library should acquire, or connect
   to other systems via Z39.50 (assuming your library has INNOPAC's
   Z39.50 client program). This is done by adding lines like:

   <A HREF="http:/suggest">SUGGESTIONS I have for the library</A>
   <A HREF="http:/acquire">BOOKS I would like the library to buy</A>
   <A HREF="http://your.innopac.ip:211/screens/z39menu.html/">
             Other systems via <b>INNOPAC Z39.50</b> </A>
     (for more discussion of setting up the Z39.50 Interface in the 
      Web OPAC, see your User Manual)

For detailed discussion of the Web OPAC setup and all of the 
available Web OPAC Options, be sure to read your User Manual.
