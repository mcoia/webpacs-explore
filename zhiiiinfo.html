<DD>The INNOPAC Gateway can be used to provide links to other systems and databases, using such protocols as Z39.50, Gopher, WWW, Telnet, etc. The Gateway module allows the library to design its own set of menu screens to indicate which resources are to be accessed. When accessing remote resources, the module will perform the login and enter the password (if required) so that users do not need to do that themselves. Access to specific databases/systems can be limited to certain types of library patrons, since the module is completely integrated with the patron database used in the circulation module. In addition, access to can be controlled by the IP address of the user's terminal. Excellent management information reports show which systems are being accessed and how much each is being used.

<DT><A NAME="ser"><B>Serials Control</B></A>
<DD>The INNOPAC Serials module handles all the functions associated with managing the receipt and processing of periodicals, continuations, standing orders, newspapers, etc, including:
<UL>
<LI>Predictive Check-in 
<LI>Claiming 
<LI>Routing and
<LI>Binding
</UL>
<BR>
All frequencies and irregularities (including advance sheets, supplements, pocket parts, etc.) are accommodated, as are all formats. Many libraries using the INNOPAC serials module subscribe to five, ten or even twenty-five thousand different serial titles. Check-in of an issue is accomplished with just a single keystroke, and SICI barcodes from serial publications are supported to identify the item. Routing slips and property labels (with name of library, name of journal, volume/issue, call number, etc.) are produced automatically as each issue is checked in. 
<P>The module allows claims for serial issues to be sent electronically to such vendors as EBSCO and Faxon using the X.12 format. The module handles serials from a variety of sources, such as gifts, exchanges, governement publications and purchases. 
<P>
Fully integrated with the INNOPAC Acquisitions module, the system produces purchase orders and handles all the fund accounting for serials, keeping the entire payment history of each title. Fund reports contain appropriations, commitments (encumbrances), expenditures and balances, and show all payments charged to  each fund. Invoices from numerous vendors can be received electronically. INNOPAC's report writer and statistical package will produce price projections for serials based on language, country, subject, vendor, fund, etc.
<P>
The serials module is fully integrated with the circulation module so that item records can be created automatically as issues arrive, enabling them to circulate immediately. When issues are bound together, the resepective item records are merged together.

<DT><A NAME="cir"><B>Circulation</B></A>
<DD>The INNOPAC Circulation module does all the record keeping and produces all of the statistical reports associated with checking out material to library users, including holds (reservation) management, renewals, overdue notices, bills, fines, recording in-house usage, etc. An extremely flexible policy file uses a three-dimensional matrix based on 255 item types, 255 patron types and hundreds of collections to support an incredible variety of loan periods, renewal rules, overdue notice content and production schedules, bills, fines, etc. Full support for <B>Reserve Book Room</B> operations is available within this module.<P>
Library systems with dozens of locations and doing as many as ten million circulations per year use the INNOPAC system.
<P>
Statistical reports on circulation activity are first rate, and are available on-line all the time for any time period in the previous three years. They cover numerous data elements that describe the patrons that borrow items, and that describe the items they borrow, for example call number, item type, etc. The reports include comparative data with the previous month and the same month last year.

The module can be used to perform scheduling of events and their required equipment. With INNOPAC release 9.1, users can book materials themselves, particularly items that are on reserve for courses.

<DT><A NAME="ill"><B>Inter-Library Loan</B></A>
<DD>The INNOPAC Inter-Library Loan module allows patrons to enter their requests while using the OPAC, and (if the library has the INNOPAC Z39.50 software installed) performs automatic checks to verify the citation against various databases using the Z39.50 protocol. ILL requests can then be transmitted electronically to<BR>
<UL>
<LI>the OCLC ILL system, 
<LI>or the British Library ARTTel system 
<LI>or via E-mail to any supplier the library desires
</UL>
Alternatively, requests can be printed. <BR>
<P>
In the OPAC, different request forms are provided for patrons to fill out, depending on
whether they are requesting a book or a journal article. The INNOPAC system
can check the request as the patron enters it to verify that the library does
not own the material being requested. INNOPAC will verify that the patron
is in good standing (and, if desired, is of a particular patron type) before 
accepting
the request. Finally, it will display the copyright notice to the patron
as it enters the request into the system.<P>
<P>
If the library has journal citation databases mounted on its INNOPAC system, patrons may enter Inter-Library Loan requests merely by selecting citations from the journal citation database(s).
<P>
If the library has INNOPAC Z39.50 client software, Inter-Library-Loan requests
may be entered while searching any Z39.50 to which database the library has access simply by selecting an item from
that database.
<P>
The ILL module allows the Inter-Library-Loan Librarian to verify the bibliographic data in the request (using Z39.50) and load into the request, automatically, bibliographic and holdings data found via Z39.50. It also allows the ILL Librarian to verify electronically that the library does not own the material requested (if it does, it offers the option of satisfying the request with the locally-owned material). Finally, it accepts the directive of the ILL Librarian to transmit the request to a supplier. Alternatively, it allows the Librarian to cancel the request or send it back to the requestor for more information.
<P>Patrons may see the status of their requests when they use INNOPAC's "View your own circulation record" function.
<P>
The ILL module keeps track of outstanding requests and has the ability to communicate electronically with the requestor if need be, and to record updates to the status of the request. 
<P>
When the item arrives from the supplier, the requestor is notified automatically to come into the library and pick up the item. If it is a book, the item is ready to be checked out using INNOPAC's regular circulation module (even though the library doesn't own the book), and the module can produce special overdue notices to the borrower in case the book is not returned. 
<P>
The module keeps excellent statistics on filled requests, including average time to supply by supplying institition, and total number of requests by journal title (in order to monitor copyright compliance). Statistics by patron type, and the ability to retrieve all requests made by a particular patron, or for a particular journal, are all available.

and the INNOPAC client (which is usable from either a character based terminal, or from Innovative's WebServer software) can connect to Z39.50 servers provided by Innovative or by others (e.g. OCLC, RLIN, Library of Congress, MELVYL, NOTIS, DRA, DYNIX, SIRSI, ADVANCE, etc.).
<P>
INNOPAC Z39.50 software supports version 2 of the Z39.50 protocol, with some features of version 3, e.g. support for display of holdings and circulation status via the OPAC format. Access control is also supported as per the version 3 standard. 
<P>
Z39.50 is completely integrated into the INNOPAC system and is used extensively, for example, in the Inter-Library Loan module.
<P>
Innovative's Z39.50 option is currently installed in more than 100 libraries.
